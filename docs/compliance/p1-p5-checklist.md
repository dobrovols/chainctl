# P1–P5 Compliance Checklist

| Principle | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| P1 – Go Craftsmanship | ✅ | `make verify` (fmt + lint), Go module imports | Root CLI wired with consistent error handling |
| P2 – Test Rigor | ✅ | Unit (`test/unit`), integration (`test/integration`), e2e (`test/e2e`) suites | envtest and KIND tests gated by environment variables |
| P3 – Operator UX | ✅ | CLI reference (`docs/cli/commands.md`), quickstart, dry-run artifacts | Commands expose `--output json`, `--dry-run`, and consistent noun-verb structure |
| P4 – Performance Budgets | ✅ | Benchmarks recorded in `artifacts/performance/*.json`, budgets documented in `docs/performance/budgets.md` | `scripts/capture-dry-run.sh` provides repeatable measurements |
| P5 – Operational Safety & Observability | ✅ | Runbook (`docs/runbooks/installer.md`), OTEL setup (`internal/telemetry/setup.go`), telemetry samples | Cluster IDs hashed via `CHAINCTL_CLUSTER_ID`; exporters configurable |

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] `make verify`
- [ ] `scripts/capture-dry-run.sh`
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] Attach artifacts from `artifacts/dry-run/` and `artifacts/performance/`

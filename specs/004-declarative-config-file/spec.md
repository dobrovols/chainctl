# Feature Specification: Declarative YAML Configuration for CLI Flags

**Feature Branch**: `004-declarative-config-file`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Declarative config file for all flags (YAML)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a platform engineer standardizing `chainctl` usage across teams, I need a declarative YAML file that captures every CLI flag value required for our workflows so we can share, review, and rerun commands consistently without relying on ad hoc shell scripts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a documented YAML configuration that defines approved flag values for a supported `chainctl` command, **When** an operator executes that command while referencing the YAML, **Then** the command runs using the declared values and completes without prompting for missing inputs.
2. **Given** a YAML configuration and additional overrides provided directly at runtime, **When** the command executes, **Then** the runtime overrides take precedence and the operator receives a summary of the effective configuration that reflects the merged result.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the YAML defines a flag or command section that `chainctl` does not recognize?
- How does the system handle YAML parsing errors or missing files when a workflow depends on the declarative configuration?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10
- Q: What default discovery behavior should `chainctl` use for declarative YAML configs when the operator does not explicitly pass `--config` (or similar)? → A: Search order: env var `CHAINCTL_CONFIG`, then `./chainctl.yaml`, then `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/chainctl/config.yaml` with fallback `~/.config/chainctl/config.yaml`.
- Q: How should a declarative YAML file organize configurations when teams need to run multiple `chainctl` commands? → A: YAML supports global defaults plus command-specific overrides within one file.
- Q: What safeguards should apply when YAML files contain sensitive flag values? → A: YAML must never contain secrets; operators must reference external secret stores.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow operators to supply a YAML file that declaratively sets flag values for any `chainctl` command that currently accepts CLI flags.
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate the YAML against the set of supported commands and flags, rejecting execution when it encounters unknown or misspelled entries and directing the operator to the problematic keys.
- **FR-003**: System MUST resolve the effective flag set by applying YAML-declared values first and then overriding them with any flags provided directly during invocation.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a human-readable and machine-consumable summary of the resolved configuration before executing impactful actions so operators can confirm the values being applied.
- **FR-005**: System MUST enforce that declarative YAML configurations do not contain sensitive secrets, directing operators to reference external secret stores or runtime injection mechanisms instead of embedding confidential values.
- **FR-006**: System MUST fail fast with an actionable error message when the declarative configuration file is missing, malformed, or cannot be accessed.
- **FR-007**: System MUST enable teams to organize YAML content with global defaults, reusable profile groups, and command-specific overrides within a single configuration artifact so related command profiles can be maintained together.
- **FR-008**: System MUST document precedence rules and discovery order for YAML files, setting the default resolution order to: environment variable `CHAINCTL_CONFIG` if present, then `./chainctl.yaml`, then `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/chainctl/config.yaml`, falling back to `~/.config/chainctl/config.yaml`.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Configuration Profile**: Represents a named set of flag values for a specific `chainctl` command, including metadata such as description, maintainers, intended environment, and optional reusable `profiles` groupings applied across commands.
- **Resolved Command Invocation**: Captures the final flag set after merging declarative YAML values with on-the-fly overrides, providing transparency for audits and troubleshooting.

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- Teams already maintain version control repositories or shared storage where YAML configurations can be reviewed and approved before execution.
- Existing flag definitions within `chainctl` remain the authoritative source for acceptable values; this feature layers a declarative input method without changing flag semantics.
- Operators are expected to manage file permissions and secret management policies consistent with their organization's compliance requirements.

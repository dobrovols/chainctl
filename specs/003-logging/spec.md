# Feature Specification: Logging Transparency for Operational Steps

**Feature Branch**: `003-logging`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add specification regarding logging, we need to log all high-level steps and the exact helm command invoked, for external commands, include stderr on failure, logs should be well structured to be ready for integration with centralized logging system like ELK, we should avoid logging of sensitive data"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an operations engineer using `chainctl` to manage Kubernetes application deployments, I need the CLI to emit structured logs that capture each major action and the exact Helm commands it runs so I can trace automation steps in centralized logging tools without exposing sensitive data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** chainctl executes a high-level workflow that triggers a Helm install, **When** the command completes successfully, **Then** the log stream includes structured entries noting the start and end of the workflow step and the sanitized Helm command that was executed.
2. **Given** an external command invoked by chainctl fails, **When** stderr contains diagnostic information, **Then** the failure log entry includes structured fields for the command context and captured stderr while confirming no sensitive credentials are exposed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when stderr contains data that could reveal secrets?
- If structured logging cannot initialize or is disabled, chainctl aborts before mutating cluster state and returns an actionable error instructing operators to re-enable logging.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: Which structured fields must appear in every workflow log entry? â†’ A: timestamp, category, message, severity

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST emit structured log entries for the start and completion of each high-level operational step within chainctl workflows.
- **FR-002**: System MUST include the exact Helm command string executed in the structured logs, redacting or omitting any sensitive values such as authentication tokens.
- **FR-003**: System MUST capture stderr output for any failed external command execution and include it in the corresponding structured failure log entry after redacting sensitive data.
- **FR-004**: System MUST format structured log entries with consistent fields (`timestamp`, `category`, `message`, `severity`) so they can be ingested by centralized logging platforms.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear differentiation between normal operations and error conditions in the logs to support rapid troubleshooting.
- **FR-006**: System MUST avoid logging sensitive secrets, access tokens, or credentials in any log entry.
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow operators to trace an action end-to-end by correlating log entries via shared identifiers (e.g., workflow or run ID).
- **FR-008**: System MUST refuse to execute cluster-changing workflows when structured logging cannot initialize, returning an actionable error before invoking bootstrap or Helm operations.

### Key Entities
- **Structured Log Entry**: Represents a single recorded action with fields for workflow identifier, step name, command details, status, timestamps, and sanitized output snippets.

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- Centralized log collection infrastructure already exists; this feature focuses on the structure and content of logs emitted by chainctl.
- Sanitization rules are defined to detect and remove sensitive data within command strings and stderr snippets before logging.
